# yt-audio-only
Firefox extension that allows users to save on bandwidth by applying an audio only mode. 

To do list:
Improve this readme.

Figure out how to create a Firefox extension

Figure out how to drill into the YT PLayer and append our own buttons to it (Some extensions do this already)

Figure out how to change a setting so that YT only feeds the user an audio feed.

Maybe toggle for bandwidth viewing so we can confirm that we're using less bandwidth??
