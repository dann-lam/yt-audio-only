##Description
99% of the actual code comes from [Youtube Audio](https://github.com/craftwar/youtube-audio), who figured out some of the parameters to remove, which I could not actually find any official documentation on.

Was curious about how these kinds of programs worked, found one that worked pretty well so I walked myself through it and understood how most of it worked. Added a button to enable it, it's not fully fleshed out, but I'm planning on making a similar button for twitch.

It could also be possible to implement a "download" button in which the audio could be saved as a weba format audio file.

## Usage

Clone the project --> In Chrome --> Extensions --> Manage Extensions --> Load unpacked --> Load the folder --> Activate the extension --> Go to a youtube video --> Push the button --> Enjoy the lesser bandwidth usage!

## To Do
It would be great if the button was on a toggle.
It would also be great if there was a to remember which should be on a video, it doesn't make too much sense to hit the button every single time a youtube video is loaded.
